Get started
===========

The ``config`` folder contains scripts allowing to perform the detection of recombinants.

``export-paths.bash`` gives the path to the dependencies using the LBBE cluster and the tools I installed in my personal space. 
If the path exportation to the dependencies have not already been provided in your ``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.profile`` file, indicate your own paths in this file and source this file (command: ```source src/config/export-paths.bash```) prior to launching any other configuration file.
